    <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>the tea leaves in a brewing pot or French press.</li> 
        <li>Heat the water to 205°F / 96°C (if you don't have a thermometer to measure the temperature, bring the water to a boil, and then leave it off-heat for about 3 minutes to reach the correct temp.), and THEN measure 2 ¼ cup of water into the brewing pot. Stir once or twice to make sure the tea leaves are saturated with water, then cover the pot and let it sit for no more than 5 - 6 minutes.</li>
        <li>Strain the tea leaves, and place the tea in the fridge to cool down.</li>
        <li>In a glass (15 - 16 oz), place some boba pearls, along with some of the sugar syrup.</li>
        <li>Pour about 1 cup of brewed tea. The tea should be chilled or at least at room temperature (if you’re adding ice).</li>
        <li>Add ice, and top up the glass with milk. Stir to combine. Taste and add more sugar syrup if you'd like the drink sweeter. </li>
